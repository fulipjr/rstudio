#the first problem wants us to find the name John Insecure within the employees table
#Let us create a new varaible that contains the name John, and then match it with the employees table
x <- employees
y <- John
xy <- match(x$name, y)
#now we have an int list with a bunch of NA and a few "1s" where the match was true
na.omit(as.data.frame(xy))
#row 217 and 432 contain the name John
View(x)
#scroll to rom 217 to find John's login.
proton(action = "login", login="johnins")

#Now we have to guess the password. My first hunch is to loop all of the possible passwords until the login is correct.
